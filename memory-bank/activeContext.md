## Current Work Focus

### Development Status
- **Stage**: MVP Polish & Bug Fixing
- **Current Branch**: development
- **Last Activity**: Fixed critical stale closure bug in debounced grammar checking that prevented real-time analysis from working when typing new content. Implemented ref-based pattern for stable function references.
- **Priority**: Ensuring core feature stability and production readiness.

### Recent Discoveries
- **Decoration vs. Mark for Highlights**: Using ProseMirror Decorations avoids unwanted `onUpdate` events and eliminates suggestion flicker compared to mark-based highlighting.
- **Position Mapping is Critical**: Accurate mapping between backend plain-text offsets and ProseMirror positions remains central.
- **ProseMirror Block Separator Handling**: Two-space block separators must be represented in both the plain text and the position map to keep offsets aligned.
- **Stale Closure Pattern in React**: Debounced functions with `useCallback` can capture stale closures when dependencies are missing. Using refs to maintain current function references solves this while preserving debounce behavior.

### Recent Fixes
- **Decoration-Based Highlighting**: Replaced mark-based grammar highlights with a DecorationSet plugin, removing document mutations and flicker.
- **Suggestion Persistence**: Added cancel logic for pending debounced checks and reran analysis after apply/ignore so suggestions no longer disappear.
- **Document Isolation**: `EditorPanel` now remounts per `documentId` (`key` prop) ensuring each doc has isolated state.
- **Initial Analysis**: Leveraged TipTap `onCreate` hook to trigger an immediate grammar/tone check on load.
- **Offset Mapping Refinement**: Rebuilt position map with `doc.textBetween` and explicit mapping of two-space separators, fixing disappearing suggestions while typing.
- **CRITICAL: Stale Closure Bug Fix**: Fixed debounced grammar checking that stopped working when typing new content. Problem was `useCallback` dependencies missing `checkGrammar` and `analyzeTone` functions, causing stale closures. Solution: Use refs (`checkGrammarRef`, `analyzeToneRef`) to maintain current function references while keeping stable debounced functions.
- **Color Consistency for Suggestions**: (earlier) styling tweaks remain effective.

## Current Challenges & Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- Chose custom grammar engine over third-party API for control and cost
- Implemented debouncing strategy for real-time features
- Used serverless architecture for scalability
- Integrated Redis caching for performance
- **Adopted a frontend position-mapping pattern** to ensure accurate translation between backend analysis (plain text) and the rich-text editor's coordinate system.

### Known Issues to Address
- Need comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Performance testing under concurrent users, especially for large documents.
- Mobile responsiveness fine-tuning
- Accessibility compliance verification
- The `WritingIssues` panel needs a "scroll-to-suggestion" feature.
- Undo/redo behavior after applying a suggestion needs refinement.
- ~~Grammar checking stops working when typing new content~~ ✅ **FIXED** - Stale closure bug resolved

### Architecture Considerations
- Current monolithic structure works for MVP
- Consider microservices for future scaling
- Evaluate need for real-time collaboration features
- Plan for internationalization if expanding globally
