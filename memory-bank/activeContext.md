# Active Context: WordWiseAI

## Current Work Focus

### Development Status
- **Stage**: MVP Polish & Bug Fixing
- **Current Branch**: development
- **Last Activity**: Fixed highlight color consistency (editor & right panel) and removed fallback CSS override. Memory Bank updated.
- **Priority**: Ensuring core feature stability.

### Recent Discoveries
- **Position Mapping is Critical**: Discovered that accurate mapping between plain-text character offsets (from the backend) and the TipTap/ProseMirror editor's internal positions is essential for highlighting and replacements to work correctly.
- **ProseMirror Block Separator**: Learned that ProseMirror's `getText()` method uses a double space (`"  "`) to separate block nodes (e.g., paragraphs), a crucial detail for building an accurate position map.

### Recent Fixes
- **Highlighting & Replacement Accuracy**: Implemented a robust position-mapping system on the frontend. This resolves a series of bugs where suggestion highlights were offset and applying suggestions failed to replace the correct text. The core real-time analysis feature is now significantly more stable.
- **Color Consistency for Suggestions**: Removed an overriding fallback CSS rule and added attribute-based styling, ensuring grammar (red), spelling (amber), and style (blue) highlights display correctly in the editor. Updated `WritingIssues` panel Tailwind classes to match these colors.

   - Monitoring and alerting

## Current Challenges & Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- Chose custom grammar engine over third-party API for control and cost
- Implemented debouncing strategy for real-time features
- Used serverless architecture for scalability
- Integrated Redis caching for performance
- **Adopted a frontend position-mapping pattern** to ensure accurate translation between backend analysis (plain text) and the rich-text editor's coordinate system.

### Known Issues to Address
- Need comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Performance testing under concurrent users, especially for large documents.
- Mobile responsiveness fine-tuning
- Accessibility compliance verification
- The `WritingIssues` panel needs a "scroll-to-suggestion" feature.
- Undo/redo behavior after applying a suggestion needs refinement.

### Architecture Considerations
- Current monolithic structure works for MVP
- Consider microservices for future scaling
- Evaluate need for real-time collaboration features
- Plan for internationalization if expanding globally

## Development Environment

### Current Setup
- Development on macOS (darwin 24.5.0)
- Using zsh shell
- npm package manager
- VS Code with Cursor AI integration

### Branch Strategy
- Main branch: production-ready code
- Development branch: active development
- Feature branches: for specific features

### Quality Assurance
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESLint for code quality
- Next.js built-in optimizations
- Manual testing workflows
