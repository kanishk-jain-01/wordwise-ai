# Active Context: WordWiseAI

## Current Work Focus

### Development Status
- **Stage**: MVP Enhancement & Production Readiness
- **Current Branch**: development
- **Last Activity**: Implemented enhanced spelling engine with multi-stage ranking system, dramatically improving suggestion quality. Successfully deployed frequency-weighted suggestions, keyboard distance awareness, phonetic matching, and context-aware n-gram analysis.
- **Priority**: Testing enhanced features and preparing for production deployment.

### Recent Discoveries
- **Multi-Stage Spelling Ranking**: Combining frequency weighting, keyboard distance, phonetic similarity, and context awareness produces dramatically better spelling suggestions than simple edit distance alone.
- **Context-Aware Suggestions**: Extracting surrounding words and using n-gram patterns (e.g., "what is", "what's up") significantly improves suggestion relevance.
- **Keyboard Layout Intelligence**: QWERTY-aware distance calculations boost suggestions for adjacent key typos (e.g., "wah" â†’ "what" where hâ†’t are adjacent).
- **Confidence Scoring Effectiveness**: Multi-dimensional confidence scoring helps filter low-quality suggestions and provides user feedback on suggestion reliability.
- **Decoration vs. Mark for Highlights**: Using ProseMirror Decorations avoids unwanted `onUpdate` events and eliminates suggestion flicker compared to mark-based highlighting.
- **Position Mapping is Critical**: Accurate mapping between backend plain-text offsets and ProseMirror positions remains central.
- **ProseMirror Block Separator Handling**: Two-space block separators must be represented in both the plain text and the position map to keep offsets aligned.
- **Stale Closure Pattern in React**: Debounced functions with `useCallback` can capture stale closures when dependencies are missing. Using refs to maintain current function references solves this while preserving debounce behavior.

### Recent Enhancements
- **ðŸš€ MAJOR: Enhanced Spelling Engine**: Implemented comprehensive multi-stage ranking system with:
  - Frequency-weighted scoring (370k+ word dictionary with frequency data)
  - Keyboard distance awareness for typo detection
  - Phonetic similarity matching using simplified Soundex
  - Context-aware n-gram analysis for better suggestions
  - Confidence scoring and intelligent filtering
  - Multiple suggestion support in UI (up to 3 ranked options)
- **Improved Suggestion UI**: Enhanced WritingIssues component to display multiple suggestions as clickable buttons with confidence scores and visual hierarchy.
- **API Enhancement**: Updated grammar check API to return multiple ranked suggestions instead of single replacements.
- **Decoration-Based Highlighting**: Replaced mark-based grammar highlights with a DecorationSet plugin, removing document mutations and flicker.
- **Suggestion Persistence**: Added cancel logic for pending debounced checks and reran analysis after apply/ignore so suggestions no longer disappear.
- **Document Isolation**: `EditorPanel` now remounts per `documentId` (`key` prop) ensuring each doc has isolated state.
- **Initial Analysis**: Leveraged TipTap `onCreate` hook to trigger an immediate grammar/tone check on load.
- **Offset Mapping Refinement**: Rebuilt position map with `doc.textBetween` and explicit mapping of two-space separators, fixing disappearing suggestions while typing.
- **CRITICAL: Stale Closure Bug Fix**: Fixed debounced grammar checking that stopped working when typing new content. Problem was `useCallback` dependencies missing `checkGrammar` and `analyzeTone` functions, causing stale closures. Solution: Use refs (`checkGrammarRef`, `analyzeToneRef`) to maintain current function references while keeping stable debounced functions.

## Current Challenges & Decisions

### Technical Decisions Made
- Chose custom grammar engine over third-party API for control and cost
- Implemented debouncing strategy for real-time features
- Used serverless architecture for scalability
- Integrated Redis caching for performance
- **Adopted a frontend position-mapping pattern** to ensure accurate translation between backend analysis (plain text) and the rich-text editor's coordinate system.

### Known Issues to Address
- Need comprehensive error handling for edge cases
- Performance testing under concurrent users, especially for large documents.
- Mobile responsiveness fine-tuning
- Accessibility compliance verification
- The `WritingIssues` panel needs a "scroll-to-suggestion" feature.
- Undo/redo behavior after applying a suggestion needs refinement.
- ~~Grammar checking stops working when typing new content~~ âœ… **FIXED** - Stale closure bug resolved

### Architecture Considerations
- Current monolithic structure works for MVP
- Consider microservices for future scaling
- Evaluate need for real-time collaboration features
- Plan for internationalization if expanding globally
